To get started:

Unix> ipython

...
[1]: from mshconvert import *
[2]: convert('sirkel4.msh', curves={7:{'type':'C', 'radius':1, 'depth': 4, 'circle_center': (0, 0)}})

This will create the rea-file (sirkel.rea) that can be read by nek5000. 

Note that this geometry is a circle and thus it has one circular boundary, number 7. The radius is 1. I choose to tranplant the curvature four elements into the geometry, hence 'depth': 4. This is completely necessary to create a decent boundary layer. 'circle_center': (0, 0) gives the location of the center of the circle that makes up the boundary. This is used to compute the radii of the inner facets.

Hope it works for you as well!
